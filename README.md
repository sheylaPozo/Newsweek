The assignment was about building a clone of [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/). 
This site possess a complex layout, which makes it great to get practice working with layouts and frameworks such as Bootstrap grid. I've really enjoyed building the site, and it has definitely given me a good grasp on how to build a layout using Bootstrap.
